        <h2 class="h2">Biography</h1>
            <p> Virat Kohli is an Indian
                cricketer who is the current captain of the India national team. A right-handed top-order batsman. He
                plays for Delhi in domestic cricket and for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League
                (IPL) as captain of the franchise since 2013. Kohli is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of
                all time. <br>

            <p class="sp"> Kohli captained India Under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia. After
                a few
                months later, he made his ODI debut for India against Sri Lanka at the age of 19. Initially having
                played as a reserve batsman in the Indian team, he soon established himself as a regular in the ODI
                middle-order and was part of the squad that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup. He made his Test debut in
                2011 and shrugged off the tag of "ODI specialist" by 2013 with Test hundreds in Australia and South
                Africa. Having reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time in
                2013, Kohli also found success in the Twenty20 format, winning the Man of the Tournament twice at the
                ICC World Twenty 20 (in 2014 and 2016). </p><br>

            <p class="sp">Kohli was appointed the vice-captain of the ODI team in 2012 and handed over the Test
                captaincy
                following Mahendra Singh Dhoni's Test retirement in 2014. In early 2017, he became the limited-overs
                captain as well after Dhoni stepped down from the position. In ODIs, Kohli has the second highest number
                of centuries and the highest number of centuries in run-chases in the world. He holds the world record
                for being the fastest batsman to 8,000, 9,000, 10,000, 11,000 and 12,000 runs in ODI cricket. He also
                holds the world record of being fastest to 23,000 international runs. Among Indian batsmen, Kohli has
                the best ever Test rating (937 points), ODI rating (911 points) and T20I rating (897 points). </p>
            <br>

            <p class="sp"> Kohli has been the recipient of many awards such as the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy (ICC
                Cricketer of the
                Year) in 2017 and 2018; ICC Test Player of the Year 2018; ICC ODI Player of the Year in 2012, 2017 and
                2018 and Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World in 2016, 2017 and 2018. He was given the Arjuna Award
                in 2013, the Padma Shri under the sports category in 2017 and the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna, the
                highest sporting honour in India, in 2018. Kohli is ranked as one of the world's most famous athletes
                by ESPN and one of the most valuable athlete brands by Forbes. In 2018, Time magazine named Kohli
                one of the 100 most influential people in the world. In 2020, Kohli was ranked 66th in Forbes list
                of the top 100 highest paid athletes in the world for the year 2020 with estimated earnings of $26
                million.</p><br>

            <p class="sp">
                Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem
                Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli is a housewife. He has an older
                brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhavna. According to his family, when he was three-years old,
                Kohli would pick up a cricket bat, start swinging it and ask his father to bowl at him.
            </p><br>

            <p class="sp">Kohli was raised in Uttam Nagar and started his schooling at Vishal Bharti Public School. In
                1998,
                the West Delhi Cricket Academy was created and a nine-year-old Kohli was part of its first intake.
                Kohli's father took him to the academy after their neighbours suggested that "Virat shouldn't waste his
                time in gully cricket and instead join a professional club". Kohli trained at the academy under
                Rajkumar Sharma and also played matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy at Vasundhara Enclave at the same
                time. Sharma recounts Kohli's early days at his academy, "He oozed talent. It was so difficult to
                keep him quiet. He was a natural in whatever he did and I was most impressed with his attitude. He was
                ready to bat at any spot, and I had to literally push him home after the training sessions. He just
                wouldn’t leave." In ninth grade, he shifted to Saviour Convent in Paschim Vihar to help his cricket
                practice. Apart from sports, Kohli was good at academics as well, and his teachers remember him as
                "a bright and alert child". Kohli's family lived in Meera Bagh until 2015 when they moved to
                Gurgaon.</p><br>

            <p class="sp">Kohli's father died on 18 December 2006 due to a stroke after being bed-ridden for a month.
                Regarding his early life, Kohli has said in an interview, "I've seen a lot in life. Losing my father at
                a young age, the family business not doing too well, staying in a rented place. There were tough times
                for the family... It's all embedded in my memory." According to Kohli, his father supported his
                cricket training during his childhood, "My father was my biggest support. He was the one who drove me to
                practice every day. I miss his presence sometimes."</p>
